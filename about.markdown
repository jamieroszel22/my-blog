# A Human in the Loop

Hi, I'm Jamie Roszel, a content developer with a passion for bridging the gap between complex technical concepts and clear, accessible documentation. With experience ranging from IBM Cloud Databases to technical education, I've dedicated my career to making technology more understandable and approachable.

## What I Do

Currently, I manage documentation for IBM Cloud Databases, where I work with everything from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, ensuring that complex database concepts are clearly explained and accessible to users. My work spans across:

- Technical documentation and API guides
- Tutorial creation and user education
- Content strategy and development
- Documentation as Code implementations

## Why This Blog?

"A Human in the Loop" was born from my unique position at the intersection of content development and emerging technologies. As someone who works daily with technical documentation and sees the rapid advancement of AI and machine learning tools, I'm fascinated by how we can maintain the crucial human element in our increasingly automated world.

## My Background

My journey has been anything but conventional. Starting as an English teacher at Cary Academy (where I helped achieve a 98% AP test passage rate), I've evolved into a technical content developer who specializes in making complex concepts accessible. Along the way, I've picked up expertise in:

- Documentation tools (GitHub, Markdown, DITA XML, FrameMaker)
- Technical communication and API documentation
- Project management and Agile methodologies
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts

## The Blog's Mission

Through this blog, I aim to:
- Share insights about staying relevant in a rapidly evolving tech landscape
- Explore the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence
- Document my journey in learning and implementing new technologies
- Create a resource for others navigating similar paths
