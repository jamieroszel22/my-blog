Today I completely revamped my blog's homepage with help from [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI assistant). While my previous layout was functional, it had become increasingly cluttered as I added more posts. I needed a solution that would make navigation easier while maintaining the clean, professional look of my Jekyll-based site.

Working with Claude, we identified key areas for improvement:

- The homepage needed better organization
- Categories weren't easily accessible
- Recent posts needed more prominence
- The overall layout needed modernization

Together, we developed a new homepage design that addresses these challenges. The most significant change is the new "Explore Topics" section at the top of the page, featuring colorful category buttons that make navigation intuitive. Each category (Python, AI, Technology, and Tutorial) has its own distinctive color scheme, making it easy for readers to find content that interests them.

The implementation process was collaborative - I would describe what I wanted to achieve, and Claude would suggest specific Jekyll and HTML implementations. We worked through several iterations, carefully maintaining compatibility with my existing Minima theme while adding modern design elements.

Key improvements include:

- A clean, centered introduction section
- Prominent category navigation buttons
- A redesigned latest posts section with category tags
- Better visual hierarchy throughout the page
- Improved spacing and readability

The technical implementation involved creating a new index.html template and updating the CSS to support the new features. Claude helped me debug various issues, including resolving conflicts between multiple index files and ensuring proper Jekyll configuration.

What I particularly appreciated about working with Claude was its ability to understand both the technical requirements and the user experience aspects of the design. When I was unsure about file placement or Jekyll's behavior, Claude provided clear explanations that helped me understand not just what to do, but why we were doing it.

This project reinforced my belief in the power of human-AI collaboration. While I drove the vision and made the final decisions about the design, Claude's technical expertise and ability to generate clean, well-structured code made the implementation process much smoother than if I had attempted it alone.

The result is a homepage that not only looks better but also serves its purpose more effectively - helping readers find and engage with my content. As my blog continues to grow, this new structure will scale well, keeping content organized and accessible.

What's next? I'm considering adding more interactive elements and perhaps some custom JavaScript functionality. But for now, I'm happy with how the redesign has transformed the user experience of my blog.
